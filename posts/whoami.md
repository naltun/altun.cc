Hello and welcome to altun.cc, my private space on the Internet for my rants, raves, ramblings, and
musings on the social sciences, art, and software. My name is Noah, but you might know me as naltun
or arav.

I work professionally as a software engineer, but my interests are vast. I do digital rights and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement" target="_blank">free software</a>
advocacy, and my tech specialties include cloud development and cybersecurity. My non-tech interests
include anthropology, geography, linguistics, art, and music.

Join me for a healthy dose of learning about our beautiful Earth.
